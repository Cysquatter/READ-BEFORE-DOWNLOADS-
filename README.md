Prerequisites

Software/Environment:
For Python-Scripts-: Python 3.x (download from python.org).
For Roblox-Mod- or Game-mods: Relevant game platforms or modding tools (e.g., Roblox client, Cheat Engine, or other modding frameworks).
For android: Android SDK, ADB, or tools like Frida, Burp Suite, or APKTool for Android security testing.
For Malware: A secure, isolated environment (e.g., virtual machine with no network access, sandbox like Cuckoo).


Operating Systems: Content targets Linux, Windows, or Android. Check repository-specific documentation for compatibility.
Dependencies: Install required libraries or tools as specified (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt for Python scripts, or specific hacking tools like Metasploit).
Permissions: Administrative privileges (sudo on Linux, Administrator on Windows) may be required for certain scripts or tools.
Secure Environment: Always run sensitive content (especially from Malware) in isolated environments to prevent harm.
